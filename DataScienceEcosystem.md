## Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

Arithmetic expressions are calculations that computers can understand. They use operators like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division. Below are some examples:

1. **Addition (`a + b`)**: Adds `a` and `b` together.
2. **Subtraction (`a - b`)**: Subtracts `b` from `a`.
3. **Multiplication (`a * b`)**: Multiplies `a` and `b` together.
4. **Division (`a / b`)**: Divides `a` by `b`.

In code, these expressions look like this:

- `5 + 3` will give you `8`.
- `10 - 2` will give you `8`.
- `4 * 2` will give you `8`.
- `16 / 2` will give you `8`.



```python
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
result_multiplication = (3 * 4)+5
print("Multiplication result:", result_multiplication)
```

    Multiplication result: 17



```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200

hours = minutes / 60

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")

```

    200 minutes is equal to 3.3333333333333335 hours.
