# Climate Change Data Analysis



This notebook will cover basic data analysis techniques applied to climate change data. We will use Python and several libraries to visualize the data.


## Data Science Languages

- Python: Widely used for data analysis and machine learning.
- R: Great for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- SQL: Used to query databases.
- Julia: Known for high performance in numerical computing.
- Java: Used in big data analytics.
- SAS: Used in business analytics.


## Data Science Libraries

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Useful for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning.
- TensorFlow: For neural networks and deep learning.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- Keras: High-level neural networks API.

## Arithmetic Expressions

Arithmetic expressions are calculations that computers can understand. They use operators like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division. Below are some examples:

1. **Addition (`a + b`)**: Adds `a` and `b` together.
2. **Subtraction (`a - b`)**: Subtracts `b` from `a`.
3. **Multiplication (`a * b`)**: Multiplies `a` and `b` together.
4. **Division (`a / b`)**: Divides `a` by `b`.

In code, these expressions look like this:

- `5 + 3` will give you `8`.
- `10 - 2` will give you `8`.
- `4 * 2` will give you `8`.
- `16 / 2` will give you `8`.



```python
result_multiplication = 5 * 3
print("Multiplication result:", result_multiplication)


result_addition = 2 + 2
print("Addition result:", result_addition)

```

    Multiplication result: 15
    Addition result: 4



```python
minutes = 60

hours = minutes / 60

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")

```

    60 minutes is equal to 1.0 hours.
